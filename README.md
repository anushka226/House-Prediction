# House-Prediction
Implemented linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset like the Boston Housing dataset for training and evaluation.

This is a to create a Machine Learning Linear Regression Model using Python. You will be analyzing a house price predication dataset for finding out the price of a house on different parameters. You will do Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions.

The following Libraries are used :-
  -- Pandas
  -- Numpy
  -- Matplotlib (plypot)
  -- Seaborn
  -- sklearn
  
We used a CSV file to keep record the database or input variable for algorithm predictions for the prices of the house on the basis of independent features such as Average area Income, Average area house age, Average area number of bedrooms and Area population depicts the dependent variable that is Price of the house.
